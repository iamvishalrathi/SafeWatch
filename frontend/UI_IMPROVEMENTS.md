### 5. **Routing Update** (`frontend/src/App.jsx`)
   - Added new route: `/all-alerts` → `AllAlerts` component

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- ❌ All alerts shown at once (cluttered)
- ❌ Simple yellow alert cards with minimal info
- ❌ No way to view alert details
- ❌ Basic pie chart with simple colors
- ❌ No search or filter capabilities

### After:
- ✅ Clean sidebar with top 10 alerts
- ✅ Rich alert cards with complete information
- ✅ Dedicated page for all alerts
- ✅ Advanced search, filter, and sort
- ✅ Modern, animated pie chart
- ✅ Download alert images
- ✅ Color-coded alert severity
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions

## Technical Details

### Alert Display Logic:
```javascript
const topAlerts = alerts.slice(0, 10);  // Show only top 10
{alerts.length > 10 && (
  <button onClick={() => navigate("/all-alerts")}>
    Show All Alerts
  </button>
)}
```

### Alert Filtering:
- By type: distress, lone_woman_night, woman_surrounded, woman_surrounded_spatial
- By search: ID, type, gesture
- By time: newest/oldest first

### Real-time Updates:
- Live.jsx: Polls every 1 second (1000ms)
- AllAlerts: Polls every 5 seconds (5000ms)

## Design Patterns

### Color Coding:
- **Distress:** `from-red-600 to-red-700` - High urgency
- **Lone Woman Night:** `from-yellow-600 to-yellow-700` - Medium urgency
- **Woman Surrounded:** `from-orange-600 to-orange-700` - High urgency

### Icons:
- 🔔 Alerts
- ⚠️ Distress (faExclamationTriangle)
- 🕐 Lone woman night (faClock)
- 👥 Woman surrounded (faUserGroup)
- 🖐️ Gesture (faHand)
- 📍 Location (faMapMarkerAlt)
- 🔍 Search (faSearch)
- 🔽 Filter (faFilter)
- 📥 Download (faDownload)

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Pagination:** Add pagination to AllAlerts for better performance with thousands of alerts
2. **Date Range Filter:** Filter alerts by date range
3. **Export:** Export filtered alerts to CSV/PDF
4. **Alert Details Modal:** Click on alert for full-screen detail view
5. **Live Notifications:** Browser notifications for new alerts
6. **Map Integration:** Show all alerts on HotspotMap in AllAlerts page
7. **Statistics:** Add alert statistics (alerts per hour, most common type, etc.)
8. **Dark/Light Mode:** Toggle for user preference
